    "description": "Topsy Turvy is a popular succulent known for its unique, wavy leaves that curl outward, giving the plant a fun and eye-catching look. The leaves are bluish-green in colour with a soft, powdery coating, and the plant grows in a neat rosette shape. With good sunlight, the leaf edges may develop a light pink shade. Topsy Turvy grows well in well-draining soil and is ideal for pots, balconies, and indoor succulent collections.",
    "dos": [
        "Provide bright, indirect light: Place near an east-facing window or slightly away from south/west windows.",
        "Use well-drained soil: A cactus/succulent mix with sand or perlite prevents root rot.",
        "Follow the “soak and dry” method—water thoroughly, then let soil dry completely before watering again.",
        "Fertilize lightly: Use diluted succulent fertilizer once or twice during the growing season (spring/summer), these are compact and slow-growing succulents ."

        "Don’t overwater: Excess moisture leads to root rot and leaf yellowing.",
