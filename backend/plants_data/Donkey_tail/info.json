    "description": "Donkey Tail Sedum is a popular trailing succulent known for its long, hanging stems covered with small, fleshy, bead-like leaves. This plant is easy to care for and ideal for beginners, as it needs bright indirect sunlight and watering only when the soil is completely dry. The leaves are delicate and may fall if handled often, so it is best kept in a stable place. With well-draining soil and minimal care, Donkey Tail Sedum adds a lush and attractive touch to indoor and balcony spaces.",

        "Provide bright, indirect light: Place near an east-facing window or slightly away from south/west windows.",

        "Follow the “soak and dry” method—water thoroughly, then let soil dry completely before watering again.",
        "Fertilize lightly: Use diluted succulent fertilizer once or twice during the growing season (spring/summer), these are compact and slow-growing succulents ."
